# Built with

- NHL Rest API
- Vanilla JS
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox

# How it works

Four AJAX XMLHttpRequests to the NHL API to get information on (1) Upcoming Fixtures, (2) Previous Results, (3) Highlight url information, (4) Pacific table standings. Information is parsed into empty objects and then added into the DOM. 

# Roadmap
